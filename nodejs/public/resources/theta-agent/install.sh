# the installer began, so that upgrading does not override an operator who had
# stopped it on purpose. That rule is right, but it cannot tell "the operator
# stopped this" from "the PREVIOUS run of this very script stopped it and then
# died" -- and the second one poisons every run after it. A failed install
# leaves the agent down; the next install sees it down, decides the stop was
# deliberate, and reports success while leaving the host unmanaged. Exactly
# that happened when the v2.22.0 `verify` check rejected the join-key install
# path: run one stopped the agent and aborted, and run two -- with the fix in
# it -- politely left the host with no agent running.
#
# So: if we are the ones who stopped it and we never reached the start step,
# start it again on the way out. Restoring the state the host was in is always
# defensible; silently leaving it unmanaged is not.
